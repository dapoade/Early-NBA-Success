# Early-NBA-Success

The purpose of this report is to infer how NCAA Division I basketball player’s stats translate to their value as NBA players in the first four years of their career. I chose to evaluate their performance over the first four years of their career because that is the life of their rookie contracts, and this might help determine whether or not a player (or type of player) will be worth a significant contract upon the completion of their rookie contract. To conduct this analysis a Multiple Linear Regression was used, where the predictor variables the stats of NCAA D1 players that were drafted between 2009 and 2015. The response variable used was the average NBA Box Plus Minus (BPM) of the first four years of each drafted player’s career. After some data manipulation my final model was chosen using Backwards AIC Selection, which left me with the most statistically significant predictors. The results of the regression showed that the best indicators of early NBA Success were a college player’s Offensive Rating, Assist Percentage, Defensive Rebound percentage, Steal percentage, if they were a Sophomore, if they played in the Pac12, if they played in the SEC, Block percentage, Height in inches, the interaction between Assist Percentage and Sophomores, and finally, the interaction between assist percentage and Seniors.
